<h1>Golden Boy</h1>
<p>Throughout Arcane, Jayce is pictured as kind of easily<br>
    manipulated, but well-meaning.</p>
    <h3>The Conflict</h3>
    <p>The problems begin when a Councilor, Mel Medarda, starts<br>
    clearly attempting to seduce and manipulate him. She forces him into a council position, primarily<br>
    for her own gain, which leads to him having his face plastered everywhere<br>
    from blimps to coffee mugs. Jayce complains about this briefly and then promptly<br>
    accepts it. Below is an image of Councilor Medarda, who I will admit, is a very<br>
    pretty lady. Then below that, an image of a Jayce coffee mug.</p>
