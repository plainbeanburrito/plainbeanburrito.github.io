        <p style="font-size: larger;color: burlywood;">With this project, I was tasked with making a triptych, or three creations that go together. I was to do these as photo collages with Photoshop.<br> 
            The pieces represent the concepts: mind, spirit, and body.​My vision with this project was to create pieces that described me, but in ways that<br> 
            would be interesting to look at. When the project was first assigned, I figured it would be difficult for me to think of what to do, as I tend to do<br>
            very little self-introspection. However, I ended up coming up with ideas relatively quickly. For my mind, I find myself lost in daydreams like one<br>
            might be lost in a labyrinth, so I used the Greek myth of the Minotaur in my work. For my spirit, I feel a lot of religious guilt and fear, so I thought<br>
            of the frightening biblical depictions of angels. For my body, I simply described myself in ways that I enjoy, like with cats and ghosts. ​
            Overall, my<br> three pieces describe me very well as a person. I enjoyed the process of creating them just about as much as I enjoy the final products.​
