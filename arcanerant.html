<h1>My Favorite Character</h1>
<p>I found myself particularly drawn to the character called Viktor.</p>
<img src="Viktor1.jpg" alt="Viktormybeloved" height="680" width="679">
<p>Viktor is a scientist who strives to create technology which will help<br>
people. His personality and goals are endearing enough to warrant him<br>
becoming a fan favorite. Early on, he partners with a man called Jayce,<br>
who he works with to create revolutionary technology.</p>
<h3>Jayce</h3>
<p>While Viktor is a fan favorite, Jayce is highly debated. He tends to fall to manipulation<br>
and some large pitfalls of capitalism (a concept unpopular with some members<br>
of the fanbase, or at least the ones on Tumblr). I have mixed feelings about<br>
him. Which I can explain <a href="jayceiscomplicated.html">in the next page.</a> Either way, below is an image of<br>
what he looks like.</p>
