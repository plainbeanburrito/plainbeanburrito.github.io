      <p style="text-indent: 50px;">For this project, I was tasked with creating a piece of Net art, or art that uses the Internet as a medium.,<br>
       The project began with a jumble of words from three news articles.<br></p>

      <p style="text-indent: 50px;">After I received my randomized prompt, "King Car and Cop Dinosaur Was on Date," I had ideas right away. <br>
       I decided that the first page would be King Car asking Cop Dinosaur out on the date. Then, I wanted you to be<br>
        able to click on either of them to see them getting ready for the date. Then, you could see the actual date and it<br> would have two possible endings. I chose to just go with basic "Good" and "Bad" endings.<br></p>
      
      <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Overall, I think this project turned out really interesting and fun. I love the finished product.</p>
