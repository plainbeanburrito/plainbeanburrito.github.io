<p>I spent my Wednesday going to a morning class and then waiting around<br>
    all day to go to an evening class. Really boring stuff, to say the least.<br>
    However, after my classes, I finished watching the show, Arcane, on Netflix.<br>
    I really enjoyed it, and honestly, I'd much rather talk about that then some<br>
    boring class day. I also spent a lot of time playing Pokemon Diamond recently,<br>
    so I'm including an image of the starter I chose.

<p>The first thing that drew me to this show was the art style. The look of it is 
    incredible, with plenty of intricate detail and realistic movements.<br> The character
    designs are charming and well-thought-out. I figured I could introduce <a href="arcanerant.html">my favorite
    characters</a> and a couple little <a href="jayceiscomplicated.html">story elements.</a> </p>
